Workout Tracker is an app that allows you to, as the name indicates, track your workouts. However, it's not only limited to that. In reality, it's a tool that provides many different useful functions related to working out.

After creating an account, you can browse the exercises that are included in the app's database. Each exercise has its own page that includes the muscles worked, an image of someone performing the exercise, and a paragraph describing how to perform the exercise. By default, the names of the muscles are simplified, but if you want to know exactly what part of the muscle the exercise targets, you can enable the detailed view to see the scientific names.

Once you have found the exercises you want, you can create your own workout, choosing the number of desired sets, repetitions, and weight for each exercise. Once you've created the workout, you can modify it at any time by going on the workout's page, where you will also see various information concerning it.

When you've created your workout, you can start a session at any time you want. Once you're in a session, the app starts tracking how much time has elapsed since the start of the workout. At the end of each set you perform, you add the set to the session with a few clicks, and the app handles the rest for you. Once you submit the last set, the session ends and is saved in the app's database.

In the history page, you can view all of your previous sessions. Clicking on a session will show you detailed information about it, such as time elapsed, or all the sets you performed.

Outside of workouts, you can track your weight, aswell as how much cardio you do. By setting a weight goal, you can let the app know how it should consider your progress (some people want to gain weight, while others want to lose some). You can also specify a maximum weight tolerance, which will be higher if you're trying to lose 50 kg, and lower if you're only trying to lose 5 kg. Cardio sessions can be added: the distance you ran and how much time it took you will be stored into the database.

The app offers you a way to view a history of your workouts, weight, and cardio sessions in the form of tables. By clicking on the icon next to the tables, you can also see the data plotted on a chart, which allows for more easier visualisation of progress.

By tracking each set you perform in your workouts, the app also lets you see all your personal records, aswell as their history. For individual exercises, the records are sorted by weight, and then by repetitions performed. Just like most data, this can also be plotted into a chart. Personal records are also tracked for other things such as workout time, distance ran in one session...

Finally, the settings page offers you the choice to switch between dark theme and light theme. Note that the light theme is not actively maintained, therefore it may not be as appealing as the default dark theme.

This app is made with Flutter. The target OS is Android, but it should also work on iOS.
Do note that this was is not intended for actual use and was only created for the CS50x course as a final project.
